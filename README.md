## A little about the repository

Here is a repository in which I will be posting some of my personal projects with the intention of evolving more and more in this vast language that is Java.

<br><br>
I will be leaving comments on some of these projects so that you can understand, those who are interested, what is happening in the project and in the code. <br>
